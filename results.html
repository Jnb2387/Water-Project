        <br>
            <p>Even though our tap water supplies are considered to be one of the safest in the world, water contamination can still occur. There are many sources of contamination, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sewage releases</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (for example, arsenic, radon, uranium)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Local land use practices (for example, fertilizers, pesticides, livestock, concentrated feeding operations)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Manufacturing processes (for example, heavy metals, cyanide)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Malfunctioning on-site wastewater treatment systems (for example, septic systems)</li>
                </ul>
