                <li><span class="bold">Coagulation and Flocculation</span>
                <p>Coagulation and flocculation are often the first steps in water treatment. Chemicals with a positive charge are added to the water. The positive charge of these chemicals neutralizes the negative charge of dirt and other dissolved particles in the water. When this occurs, the particles bind with the chemicals and form larger particles, called floc.</p>

                <li><span class="bold">Sedimentation</span>
                <p>During sedimentation, floc settles to the bottom of the water supply, due to its weight. This settling process is called sedimentation.</p>

                <li><span class="bold">Filtration</span>
                <p>Once the floc has settled to the bottom of the water supply, the clear water on top will pass through filters of varying compositions (sand, gravel, and charcoal) and pore sizes, in order to remove dissolved particles, such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and chemicals.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li><span class="bold">Disinfection</span>
                <p>After the water has been filtered, a disinfectant (for example, chlorine, chloramine) may be added in order to kill any remaining parasites, bacteria, and viruses, and to protect the water from germs when it is piped to homes and businesses.</p>

    <p>Household water treatment systems are composed of two categories: <a href="http://www.nsf.org/services/by-industry/water-wastewater/residential-water-treatment/point-of-use-and-point-of-entry-systems">point-of-use and point-of-entry</a> (NSF). Point-of-entry systems are typically installed after the water meter and treat most of the water entering a residence. Point-of-use systems are systems that treat water in batches and deliver water to a tap, such as a kitchen or bathroom sink or an auxiliary faucet mounted next to a tap.</p>
    <p>The most common types of household water treatment systems consist of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Filtration Systems</span><br />
        A water filter is a device which removes impurities from water by means of a physical barrier, chemical, and/or biological process.<br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">Water Softeners</span><br />
        A water softener is a device that reduces the hardness of the water. A water softener typically uses sodium or potassium ions to replace calcium and magnesium ions, the ions that create "hardness."<br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">Distillation Systems</span><br />
        Distillation is a process in which impure water is boiled and the steam is collected and condensed in a separate container, leaving many of the solid contaminants behind.<br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">Disinfection</span><br />
        Disinfection is a physical or chemical process in which pathogenic microorganisms are deactivated or killed. Examples of chemical disinfectants are chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and ozone. Examples of physical disinfectants include ultraviolet light, electronic radiation, and heat.</li>
    </ul>
